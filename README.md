R code used for my interview presentation for the role of  Junior Data Scientist at Public Health Wales, which required analysis of the NHS Wales Programme Budget.

The data used are provided in the data folder and were originally downloaded from https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Health-and-Social-Care/Health-Finance/NHS-Programme-Budget.

After downloading the data folder, the first script to run is 'dataprep.R' as it loads and formats the data ready for analysis.

'analysis.R' contains code relating to analysis and visualisations.

'forecast.R' contains code relating to forecasting the next 5 years of NHS Wales expenditure.
